    "In the previous lab, we used the min-bisection algorithm to reconstruct the two communities. As we saw in one of the previous questions, min-bisection is extremely inefficient. In this section, we will develop a more efficient algorithm for the community detection problem. We will use $G(V, E)$ to denote the undirected graph that we observe, where $V$ is the set of nodes $(|V|=n)$, and $E$ is the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider an intuitive algorithm to solve the community detection problem. As we have seen, the goal of community detection is to separate the nodes into two communities, such that the number of edges within the same community is as large as possible and the number of edges between two communities is as small as possible. To achieve this goal, we consider the \"score\" of a particular separation. For an edge within a community, we get one point; for an edge between two communities, we get minus one point. We want to maximize the score over all possible separations. We identify a choice of communities by a vector $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\pm1$ entries such that $x_i$ will be $+1$ if node $i$ is in one community and $-1$ if it is in the other. We also define $A$ as the $n\\times n$ matrix with zero diagonal whose non diagonal entries are given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_{ij}=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if }(i,j)\\in E\\\\\n",
    "-1 & \\text{if }(i,j)\\notin E\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then we can show that, maximizing the score is equivalent to the following optimization problem (think about the reason by yourself):\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\max &~~x^TAx \\\\\n",
    "s.t. &~~x_i=\\pm1.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "However, since this optimization problem is combinatorial and hard to solve, we need to relax the constraint that $x_i$ has to be $\\pm1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the objective of the optimization problem:\n",
    "$x^TAx$. According to knowledge in linear algebra, we know that $x^TAx=\\text{Tr}(x^TAx)=\\text{Tr}(Axx^T)$. Here, \"Tr\" denotes the trace of a square matrix, i.e., the sum of all the elements on the diagonal. We can see that $x^TAx=\\text{Tr}(x^TAx)$ is obvious because the trace of a scalar is still itself; and $\\text{Tr}(x^TAx)=\\text{Tr}(Axx^T)$ is because of the fact that $\\text{Tr}(AB)=\\text{Tr}(BA)$. If we denote the rank-one matrix $xx^T$ by $X$, then the previous optimization problem is equivalent to:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\max &~~\\text{Tr}(AX) \\\\\n",
    "s.t. &~~X=xx^T\\text{ and }x_i=\\pm1.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this problem is still hard to solve, we need to relax the constraints on $X$. As we can see, the diagonal elements of $X$ are all 1. Further, we can see that $X$ is positive semidefinite.\n",
    "(A matrix $D\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is called a positive semidefinite matrix if and only if for any vector $u\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, there is $u^TDu\\ge 0$). \n",
    "An optimization problem with linear objective functions and matrix variables which are constrained to be positive semidefinite is called a semidefinite program (SDP). SDPs are convex optimization problems, and therefore, the global minimum can be found in polynomial time. Therefore, instead of solving the combinatorial optimization problem, we solve the following SDP problem:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\max &~~\\text{Tr}(AX)\\\\\n",
    "s.t. &~~X_{ii}=1\\\\\n",
    "&X\\succeq 0,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "and hope the the relaxed optimization problem can give us the same answer as the original problem. It is proved that if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ satisfy some conditions, the solution to the SDP problem $X^*$ will be the outer product of the solution to the combinatorial optimization problem $x^*$, i.e., $X^*=x^*x^{*T}$. We will use the CVX package for Python to solve this SDP:\n",

    "\n",
    "http://cvxopt.org/userguide/coneprog.html#semidefinite-programming.\n",

    "Specifically, we will solve the dual SDP problem. We will use different data structures from the previous parts in order to use CVX. Therefore, we define some new functions which are useful in this part."
